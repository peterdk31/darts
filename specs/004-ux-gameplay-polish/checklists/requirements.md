# Specification Quality Checklist: UX & Gameplay Polish

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan` or `/speckit-tasks`.
- The 11 feedback items are grouped into 10 user stories (sticky header + player switch overlay are combined as User Story 1 since they both address turn awareness).
- No clarifications needed — all items had clear intent from the user's feedback.
